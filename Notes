What is this?

This is ambition. Or stupidity. It's often hard to decide.

We want to build a system that:
    1. Takes a (location|search_key|entity|..)? as input.
    2. Generates maps of events and context across a time span.
        - How do we get this information?
        - How does the time span function? How much do we need?
        - How do we get the superset of all information to filter by search?
        - How do we filter relevant information?
        - How do we decide on relevance?
    3. RANDOMNESS.
        - How much of the future actually is predictable?
        - How can we know this?
        - How much is truly chaotic?
        - What do we do about this chaotic behavior? Can anything be done?
        - How does that affect things? Can we narrow our prediction focus then?
    4. What is the condition for success?
        - How do we decide if we have made a correct prediction? 
        - Will knowledge of the prediction affect the predicetion? Will a prediction only be succesful if it is hidden?
    5. What are we missing?
        - Known unknowns?
        - Known knows?
        - Unknown knowns?
        - Uknown unknowns?
